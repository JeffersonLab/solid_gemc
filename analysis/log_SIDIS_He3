SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.2/pass1, new GEM, no LGC, no EC, in (2016/01)
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.2/pass2, optimize hgc,has LGC, has EC as whole, (2016/02)
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass3, turn on mother particle, add LGC virtual plane, use TungstenPowder for He3 collimator which has 60% density of Tungsten, use external materiel for H3 as SL_target_He3_He3_10amg instead of internal He3_10amg and the result should be same (2016/07)
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass4, ,change SPD scintilator material from PVT alike to PS, 
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass5, fix LASPD overlap with GEM, change LASPD from 5mm to 20mm, FASPD from 3mm to 5mm, use SPD with scintilator material PVT alike, use segmented EC with scintilator material PS
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass6,svn rev1153,change LGC mirror,HGC,GEM sector numbering to make its 1st sector center at 96deg, LGC PMT 1st is center at 97.7deg, fix LGC H12700 QE near 200nm from 0.03 to 0.3,GEM has 7 planes and grouped
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass7,svn rev1169,GEM change back to 6 planes, used for 2019 precdr
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass8,2019 spring, same like pass7, study HGC window thickness
SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass9,2020 spring, same like pass7, using solid_gemc_1.0.0 with container

====== run2 20141022======
change based on previous version

general:
running simulation with a devel version of GEMC which is similar to GEMC 2.1 within JLAB_VERSION=1.1 framework.
And QGSP_BERT_HP physics list and two version of geant4 are tried, 4.9.5.p01 and 5.9.6.p02, so that we check changes from previous simulation using geant4.9.5.p01 and QGSP_BERT_HP
The binary code used are at
/home/zwzhao/apps/jlab_root_geant4.9.6.p02
/home/zwzhao/apps/jlab_root_geant4.9.5.p01
All SoLID related files are in SVN at revision 667, get it this way
svn co -r 667 https://jlabsvn.jlab.org/svnroot/solid/solid_gemc2/
other info are here
https://hallaweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Solid_Background#run_2

geometry:
fixed previously known problem
LA_SPD 0.5cm is added, FA_SPD 0.3cm is there also
full MRPC geometry
all geometry converted to GEMC 2 format and store in text format, not using datbase

event generator:
event generator eicRate is updated to produce "normalized" output directly, the single normalization factor (corresponding to total crosssection) is "rate" in output
A comparasion to the normalization factor used previously is here
http://hallaweb.jlab.org/12GeV/SoLID/download/sim/background/normalization_factor_comparison.pdf
http://hallaweb.jlab.org/12GeV/SoLID/download/sim/background/normalization_factor_comparison.pptx
Please note in both mode of running, "weighted" evenly distributed events in phase space with "rate" per event or "normalized" events distributed accroding to crossection with same "rate" for every events, the normalization only applies to a single file. If you produce several files with same number of events, then add them together, you need to divide by the addtional normalization, the number of files.
