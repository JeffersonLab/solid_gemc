== Info =============================================================
This is to test SoLID field map

== note about gemc ==============================================================
general note
it needs MAX_FIELD_STEP to be small value close to ???????

about gemc 2.9 in JLAB_VERSION 2.5
1. it needs FIELD_PROPERTIES option to load any field
2. it treats coordinate of local field map as absolute coordinate in root volume. old gemc 2.3 in JLAB_VERSION 1.3 treat as local coordinate in its mother volume. So gemc 2.9 needs to use DISPLACE_FIELDMAP option to load oxford_ptarget at correct location

about gemc 2.3 in JLAB_VERSION 1.3
1. it had a bug handling cylindrical-x and cylindrical-y field. It was fixed in 2020/05 for solid used jlab 1.3 at /group/solid/apps/jlab_root/1.3/Linux_RedHat7.9-x86_64-gcc4.8.5/gemc/2.3/source/fields/symmetries/cylindrical.cc and for github https://github.com/gemc/source/issues/168

== test SoLID SIDIS NH3 beam bending ======================================

This is to find angle and position of beamline chicane to let beam go into NH3 target field, then go out along regular beamline which is along solenoid axis

NH3 magnet made of Helmholz coils has a "solenoid" field along +x or -x direction in its map.

set up env at jlab ifarm with instruction at https://github.com/JeffersonLab/solid_release/blob/master/howto.md
then run this to shoot the positive chargedgeantino from origin at solenoid center backwards toward NH3 target
(chargedgeantino is better then e+ because it has no energy loss in field.)
