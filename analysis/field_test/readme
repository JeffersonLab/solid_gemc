== field map =============================================================
solenoid_CLEOv8.dat  has 1cm grid, just a copy from the field dir at ../../field

oxford_ptarget.dat has 1cm grid, just a copy from the field dir at ../../field

oxford_ptarget_1mm.dat has 1mm grid and needs download from
https://hallaweb.jlab.org/12GeV/SoLID/download/field/oxford_ptarget_1mm.dat

== test NH3 target beam chicane angle ======================================
This is to angle and position of beamline chicane to let beam go into NH3 target field, then go out along regular beamline which is along solenoid axis

NH3 magnet made of Helmholz coils has a "solenoid" field along +x direction in its map.

in "beam__geometry_Original.txt", the field holder and several planes 
please note the field holder is enlarged to include large area while it still stop at solenoid entrance

set up env at jlab ifarm
> source /group/solid/solid_github/JeffersonLab/solid_gemc/set_solid 1.3 /group/solid/apps/jlab_root /group/solid/solid_github/JeffersonLab/solid_gemc"
then run this to shoots positron from origin at solenoid center backwards toward NH3 target
> solid_gemc beam.gcard -BEAM_P="e+,11*GeV,180*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,0)cm"
or flip target field, solenoid field or both
> solid_gemc beam.gcard -BEAM_P="e+,11*GeV,180*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,0)cm" -SCALE_FIELD="oxford_ptarget, -1"
> solid_gemc beam.gcard -BEAM_P="e+,11*GeV,180*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,0)cm" -SCALE_FIELD="solenoid_CLEOv8, -1"
> solid_gemc beam.gcard -BEAM_P="e+,11*GeV,180*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,0)cm" -SCALE_FIELD="oxford_ptarget, -1" -SCALE_FIELD="solenoid_CLEOv8, -1"

the output "beam.txt" has hit on the planes at z=-3500,-4000,-4500mm where z=-3500mm is target center
avg_y and avg_z tells the position in mm, 
atan(py/pz) tells the theta angle in rad,
atan(py/px) tells the phi angle in rad

"beam.txt_11GeV_oxford_v8" has avg_y=-21.9503mm, theta 2.553 deg and phi 90 deg at z=-4000mm
"beam.txt_11GeV_oxfordflip_v8" has avg_y=21.9503mm, theta 2.553 deg and phi -90 deg at z=-4000mm
"beam.txt_11GeV_oxford_v8flip" shows solenoid field direction has no effect
"beam.txt_11GeV_oxfordflip_v8flip" shows solenoid field direction has no effect

== test particles bending by NH3 target field and SoLID solenoid field ===============================

Use the two field in vacuum with no material and use some virtual planes to observer tracks bending

set up env at jlab ifarm
> source /group/solid/solid_github/JeffersonLab/solid_gemc/set_solid 1.3 /group/solid/apps/jlab_root /group/solid/solid_github/JeffersonLab/solid_gemc
run simulation in interactive mode
> solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_NH3.gcard -BEAM_P="e-,5*GeV,12*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,-350)cm" -FIELD_VERBOSITY=4 -USE_GUI=1
run simulation in batch mode
> solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_NH3.gcard -BEAM_P="e-,5.5*GeV,25*deg,0*deg" -SPREAD_P="5.5*GeV,25*deg,180*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,-350)cm" -SPREAD_V="(2.4,1.413)cm" -N=1e5
> evio2root -INPUTF=out.evio 

To test oxford_ptarget_1mm.dat, use solid_SIDIS_NH3_1mm.gcard

test particles bending by NH3

Zhiwen Zhao, 2017/10/23
"solenoid_ptarget.dat" map is wrong which gives about 60% larger field integral for beam
replace it with "g2p_ptarget.dat" which is calculated by 
hallbfield.f for g2p Helmholtz calculation and agrees within 1% with measurement
