generated based on Eend 
Radial binning is 8 see trig_low_R and trig_high_R
momentum binning is 35 see P_low and P_high

Routines GetPionTriggerEffi and GetElectronTriggerEffi would return the trigger efficiency when radius index and momentum index (bin index) are passed to them
The last radii index in the trig_pi_eff and trig_ele_eff gives the trigger efficiency for all radii average

Use routines GetRadiusIndex and GetMomentumIndex to get the bin index for radius and momentum
The radius is at the front face of the EC
