Hi Paul,

I'm attaching the newest data for the SOLID tubes along with two reference
drawings for the different styles of tube layouts.  The tube layouts for the
other quadrants are just mirror images of these so I just flipped the signs
in the spreadsheet.  The top half of the spreadsheet is from Victors
original model without the additional tubes we talked about last week.  The
bottom half is from my model.  Take a look and if you have any questions or
find any mistakes please let me know.  

Have a good weekend.

Tom
