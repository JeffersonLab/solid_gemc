The current space within the endcap is 90-270cm in radius at FAEC location.
Besides the supporting structure, I think we want to fill it up with EC modules to maximize acceptance.

For the next iteration of endcap design, we should try to reduce the inner radius from 90cm to 85 or 80cm to optimize the most forward angle detection for SIDIS.
