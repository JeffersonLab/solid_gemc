Here is a set of scripts to process root tree output from solid_gemc

individual detector response is handled in their function
analysis_tree_solid_lgc.C
analysis_tree_solid_hgc.C
analysis_tree_solid_ec.C
analysis_tree_solid_spd.C
analysis_tree_solid_mrpc.C

Then they are used for various analysis by
analysis_PVDIS.C
analysis_SIDIS.C

run the scripts after compilation to avoid error or slowness
see example in script getnumber_SIDIS_He3,getnumber_SIDIS_NH3 and getnumber_PVDIS to run it on ifarm
