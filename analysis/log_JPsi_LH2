JPsi_LH2_JLAB_VERSION_1.2/pass1,in 2016/01, new GEM, no LGC, no EC,
JPsi_LH2_JLAB_VERSION_1.2/pass3,has LGC,in 2016/03, has EC as whole, with mother particles,add LGC virtual plane
JPsi_LH2_JLAB_VERSION_1.2/pass4,in 2016/05,add another virtual plane for muon large angle
JPsi_LH2_JLAB_VERSION_1.2/pass5,svn rev1171, in 2016/11, similar to SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass7

====== run2 20150122======
change based on previous version

general:
running simulation with a devel version of GEMC which is similar to GEMC 2.1 within JLAB_VERSION=1.1 framework.
And QGSP_BERT_HP physics list and two version of geant4 are tried, 4.9.5.p01 and 5.9.6.p02, so that we check changes from previous simulation using geant4.9.5.p01 and QGSP_BERT_HP
The binary code used are at
/home/zwzhao/apps/jlab_root_geant4.9.6.p02
/home/zwzhao/apps/jlab_root_geant4.9.5.p01
All SoLID related files are in SVN at revision 667, get it this way
svn co -r 667 https://jlabsvn.jlab.org/svnroot/solid/solid_gemc2/

geometry:
15cm LH2 target is at -315cm and beamline, everything else is same like SIDIS setup
fixed previously known problem
LA_SPD 0.5cm is added, FA_SPD 0.3cm is there also
full MRPC geometry
all geometry converted to GEMC 2 format and store in text format, not using datbase

event generator:
event generator eicRate is updated to produce "normalized" output directly, the single normalization factor (corresponding to total crosssection) is "rate" in output
Please note in both mode of running, "weighted" evenly distributed events in phase space with "rate" per event or "normalized" events distributed accroding to crossection with same "rate" for every events, the normalization only applies to a single file. If you produce several files with same number of events, then add them together, you need to divide by the addtional normalization, the number of files.
