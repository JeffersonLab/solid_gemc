This tool is to calculate PVDIS Figure of Merit which is Apv_Err in Q2 and x bin

It uses root output from full solid simulation

how to run it
root 'analysis_PVDIS_FOM("sim.root","gen.root")'

a test
root 'analysis_PVDIS_FOM("/work/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/PVDIS_LD2_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass7/farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_dirty_weighted_eDIS/out.root","/work/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/PVDIS_LD2_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass7/farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_dirty_weighted_eDIS/gen.root")'

results are in "output.root"

It use result eDIS from generator eicRate
Apv is checked with two method
1. Apv=0.84e-4*Q2
2. Apv=Abeam from the generator

Abeam is not stored in root output from full solid simulation yet
So it has to be read from root output from generator for now

The code analysis_PVDIS_FOM is modified from pvdis_FOM.C to read root output of from full solid simulation
pvdis_FOM.C is just a copy from https://jlabsvn.jlab.org/svnroot/solid/study/PVDIS_FOM/
