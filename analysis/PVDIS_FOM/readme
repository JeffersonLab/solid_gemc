This tool is to calculate PVDIS Figure of Merit which is Apv_Err in Q2 and x bin

It uses root output from full solid simulation

how to run it
root 'analysis_PVDIS_FOM("sim.root","gen.root")'

a test
root 'analysis_PVDIS_FOM("/work/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/PVDIS_LD2_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass7/farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_dirty_weighted_eDIS/out.root","/work/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/PVDIS_LD2_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass7/farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_dirty_weighted_eDIS/gen.root")'

results are in "output.root"

It use result eDIS from generator eicRate
Apv is checked with two method
1. Apv=0.84e-4*Q2
2. Apv=Abeam from the generator

Abeam is not stored in root output from full solid simulation yet
So it has to be read from root output from generator for now

The code analysis_PVDIS_FOM is modified from pvdis_FOM.C to read root output of from full solid simulation
pvdis_FOM.C is just a copy from https://jlabsvn.jlab.org/svnroot/solid/study/PVDIS_FOM/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
analysis_PVDIS_FOM_new.C is the file to get the FOM for PVDIS using simulation file by gemc devel

require root 6 and do the following
source /group/solid/apps/root/root_v6.18.04.Linux-centos7-x86_64-gcc4.8/bin/thisroot.csh
.L analysis_PVDIS_FOM_new.C+
analysis_PVDIS_FOM("filename")    # for normal root files
analysis_PVDIS_FOM("filename",true)  # for devel pass1 file with bad root entry

example file is locaded at: /volatile/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/PVDIS_JLAB_VERSION_devel/pass2/solid_PVDIS_LD2_moved_dirty_weighted_eAll_filenum100_1e6.root

currently we can use rate w/o internal radiative effect. Use Is_Rad defined at the beginning of the code to turn it on/off.
Note that the eDIS generator doesn't have internal radiative effect. Only the eAll generator currently has. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
analysis_PVDIS_FOM_sim.cxx and fileReducer.cxx are the latest file to get the FOM for PVDIS using simulation file by gemc devel
fileReduce.cxx takes the GEMC simulation output, and extract useful info for the FOM. The reason is that the GEMC outputs are 
usually very large and they contain too many other infomation that is not needed for the FOM. Change the input file name on line 41. 
And then in root do:
.L fileReducer.cxx+
fileReducer()

One can then take the output of fileReducer and feed it into analysis_PVDIS_FOM_sim.cxx to get the FOM.
If one wants to get the FOM for the 6.6 GeV beam energy, one will need to comment out line 41.
To run the code, in root, one can do:
.L analysis_PVDIS_FOM_sim.cxx
analysis_PVDIS_FOM_sim("input_file_name.root")
