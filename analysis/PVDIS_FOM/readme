This tool is to calculate PVDIS Figure of Merit which is Apv_Err in Q2 and x bin

= How to use it =
1. first you need to have inclusive electron generator to generate something like 1e6 electrons with LUND format, then copy the lund file here and name it solid_PVDIS_electron.lund
2. then source your set_eic and run solid simulation with no physics and no secondary particles 
gemc solid_PVDIS_electron.gcard
3. convert output evio to root tree
evio2root -INPUTF=solid_PVDIS_electron.evio
4. use the analysis code to look at result  (this code needs modification to work)
pvdis_FOM.C("solid_PVDIS_electron.root",false)  //without trig cut
pvdis_FOM.C("solid_PVDIS_electron.root",true)   //with trig cut

= history =

This is adopted from solid_gemc/analysistool/baffle/pvdis_FOM.C which take GEMC 1.x output root file and modifed to work with GEMC 2.x output root file
This is tested with jlab_version=1.2
