EC response 

Example to get three shower response to a 0.1 GeV electron is

response> root
root [0] .L FastResponse.C+
root [1] FastResponse("e",.1)
FastResponse - INFO - openned Elec.10.11.12.root_DrawLowEBgd_EDepShowerOverE_Dist_Read.root
(double)1.23274493483970113e-01
root [2] FastResponse("e",.1)
(double)3.97026899205772110e-02
root [3] FastResponse("e",.1)
(double)4.74758643658717353e-02

Each call return a shower energy reading which is stochastically generated. Note it can be larger than the input
particle energy due to the sample fluctuation, i.e. the calorimeter energy resolution.

PS: for PVDIS there are two species of local calorimeter triggers :
1. 2.5 GeV electron trigger: trigger on sum of 70cm^2 shower energy deposition > 2.1 GeV
2. 2.0 GeV electron trigger: trigger on sum of 70cm^2 shower energy deposition > 1.6 GeV 
Note, the pre-shower information is not summed to the trigger algorithm. 

root files which record the response of the calorimeter to wide energy range of electron, pion and
photons. They are used in, e.g. rate and pile up studies. The default calorimeter was used in this simulation (2X0
Pb + 2cm Scint preshower + 18X0 Shashlyk(0.5mm Pb+1.5mm Scint/layer)).

In each root file, there are three objects: 
======================================
KEY: TH2F     EDepPreshower_Dist;
======================================
x axis : scintillator energy deposition in preshower. 
         Preshower calibrated energy (MeV) = x-bin-center*3.81493+97.9701
y axis : kinematic energy of incoming particle, expressed in log scale
z axis : probability for given particle in y-axis bin to deposit energy in one x-bin 
======================================
KEY: TH2F     EDepShowerOverE_Dist;
======================================
x axis : scintillator energy deposition in shower, divided by total energy of incoming particle. 
         Shower calibrated energy/E_total = 3.91047 * x-bin-center
y axis : kinematic energy of incoming particle, expressed in log scale
z axis : probability for given particle in y-axis bin to deposit energy in one x-bin 
======================================
KEY: TCanvas  DrawLowEBgd_EDepShowerOverE_Dist_Read;
======================================

Draw this object should reproduce the attached plots with the above two histograms

EC response in lateral distribution

In addition to the last Elog, the lateral distribution of calorimeter response is parametrized for fast trigger
simulations. 

*The data file contain the distributions are in the 2nd attachment. 
*A example macro to read this data file is shown in the 3rd attachment. 
*Example to use this macro shown in the first attachment, generated using the following commands:

[jinhuang@mitnig CaloSim_Srv]$ root
root [0] .L ECLateralDistribution.C
root [1] gStyle->SetPalette(1)
root [2] ECLateralDistribution(kSIDIS_FORWARD,kElectron,3.5)->Draw("colz")

In this example, ECLateralDistribution returns a TH2D histogram of a 3.5-GeV electron shower energy distribution
in R-phi plane. For more information, please check the documentation in ECLateralDistribution.C
