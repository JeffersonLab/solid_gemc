change based on previous version

general:
running simulation with a devel version of GEMC which is similar to GEMC 2.1 in GEMC 2.1 within JLAB_VERSION=1 framework. 
And QGSP_BERT_HP physics list and two version of geant4 are tried, 4.9.5.p01 and 5.9.6.p02, so that we check changes from previous simulation using geant4.9.5.p01 and QGSP_BERT_HP
All SoLID related files are in SVN at revision 667 here
https://jlabsvn.jlab.org/svnroot/solid

geometry:
fixed previously known problem
all geometry converted to GEMC 2 format and store in text format, not using datbase

event generator:
event generator eicRate is updated to produce "normalized" output directly, the single normalization factor (corresponding to total crosssection) is "rate" in output
A comparasion to the normalization factor used previously is here

http://hallaweb.jlab.org/12GeV/SoLID/download/sim/background/normalization_factor_comparison.pptx
Please note in both mode of running, "weighted" evenly distributed events in phase space with "rate" per event or "normalized" events distributed accroding to crossection with same "rate" for every events, the normalization only applies to a single file. If you produce several files with same number of events, then add them together, you need to divide by the addtional normalization, the number of files.

file:
"EM" in file name means all real materials and beam on target which needs normalization by current/nevent (same as "EM" previously)
"clean_weighted" in file name means kryptonite for all geometry and weighted generator (same as "other" previously)
"dirty_normalized" in file name mean all real materials and normalized generator (same as "actual" previously)

known problem
for non-EM background, we used lead baffle and other "krypotnite" for "real" files, we should use all actual material and produce "actual" files

general:
use gemc 1.7 with geant4.9.5.p01 and QGSP_BERT_HP physics list
some file may not use prothreshold 0.01mm for sensitive detector

forward EC virtual entrance plane is R(90,270)cm, while forward EC module should cover R(110,265)cm 
So apply the R cut yourself to look at rate
This is to avoid rerun the simulation later if we decide to change the EC module coverage

EM background:
use 11GeV electron on target with 50uA current

non-EM background:
use all "kill" part except baffle as lead, no secondary particle, medium maybe air
rate from eicRate

event generator:
current event generator eicRate only produce events evenly distributed in phase space with individual rate per event
A modified private copy of event generator for hadron is at  /home/zwzhao/work_halla/solid/solid_svn/solid/evgen/eicRate_new/
It uses a two step process (creating crossection histgram, then throw events accordingly) to produce hadron. The "rate" in output is not used, a single normalization factor is determined by comparing the new result to old output. This should gives more accurate 
see Normalization below

Normalization for EM background  (current/Nevent):  50e-6/1.6e-19/1e8
Normalization for hadron background:
	  if (Is_pip || Is_pim || Is_pi0) thisrate=155000.;
	  if (Is_Kp || Is_Km) thisrate=3500.;
	  if (Is_Ks || Is_Kl) thisrate=1750.;
	  if (Is_p) thisrate=27000.;

files:
main result is in dir baffle_babarbafflemore1_block which has photon block before EC
while baffle_babarbafflemore1 has result without the photon block
"other" in file name means kryptonite for all geometry 
"real" in file name mean lead baffle and kryptonite for everything else
