the code shoot beam into target and count the particles on various detectors.
physcis is handled by geant4 depending the chosen physicslist.
Dominant channel generally is EM which mean electrons and photons. neutrons can be obtained if particular neutron physicslist is used.

here is an example how to run it.

run "run_solid_CLEO_SIDIS_3he"
this shoots beam into target and output detector hits in evio format

run "gemc_evio2root background_solid_CLEO_SIDIS_3he_5e7.evio background_solid_CLEO_SIDIS_3he_5e7.root"
this converts evio to root format

in root, run ".x root2hit.C("background_solid_CLEO_SIDIS_3he_5e7.root")"
this converts hits in flux bank into a txt file to reduce file size.

compile packacge niel to have niel_fun_lib.so

in root, run ".L ../niel/niel_fun_lib.so"

in root, run ".x background.C("background_solid_CLEO_SIDIS_3he_5e7.txt",5e7)"
this plot histograms showing hits and store them in background_solid_CLEO_SIDIS_3he_5e7_output.root
