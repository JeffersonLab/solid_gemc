known problem
for non-EM background, we used lead baffle and other "krypotnite" for "real" files, we should use all actual material and produce "actual" files

general:
use gemc 1.7 with geant4.9.5.p01 and QGSP_BERT_HP physics list
The binary code used are at
/home/zwzhao/apps/jlab_software_1.7
All SoLID related files are in SVN at revision 457, get it this way
svn co -r 457 https://jlabsvn.jlab.org/svnroot/solid/solid_gemc/database_io/

geometry:
1. some file may not use prothreshold 0.01mm for sensitive detector
2. forward EC virtual entrance plane is R(90,270)cm, while forward EC module should cover R(110,265)cm 
So apply the R cut yourself to look at rate. This is to avoid rerun the simulation later if we decide to change the EC module coverage
3. EM background: use 11GeV electron on target with 50uA current
4. non-EM background: use all "kill" part except baffle as lead, no secondary particle, medium maybe air rate from eicRate

event generator:
current event generator eicRate only produce events evenly distributed in phase space with individual rate per event
A modified private copy of event generator for hadron is at  /home/zwzhao/work_halla/solid/solid_svn/solid/evgen/eicRate_new/
It uses a two step process (creating crossection histgram, then throw events accordingly) to produce hadron. The "rate" in output is not used, a single normalization factor is determined by comparing the new result to old output. This should gives more accurate 
see Normalization below
Normalization for EM background  (current/Nevent):  50e-6/1.6e-19/1e8
Normalization for hadron background:
	  if (Is_pip || Is_pim || Is_pi0) thisrate=155000.;
	  if (Is_Kp || Is_Km) thisrate=3500.;
	  if (Is_Ks || Is_Kl) thisrate=1750.;
	  if (Is_p) thisrate=27000.;
