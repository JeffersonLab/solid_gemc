====== current 20131010======
change based on previous version

known problem:
GEM virtualhodoscope overlaps with GEM, ignore its result
GEM first and second gas chamber use same flux ID, it could cause problem recording hits
SPD is not in simulation
MRPC has too thin glass due to a bug using mm instead of cm
beamline window is 100um G4_Be, instead of G4_BERYLLIUM_OXIDE

general:
use gemc 1.7 with geant4.9.5.p01 and QGSP_BERT_HP physics list
The binary code used are at
/home/zwzhao/apps/jlab_software_1.7
All SoLID related files are in SVN at revision 457, get it this way

geometry:
1. newly optimized target collimater for forward angle blocking,
see compare_pim_targetcollimator.png
2. heavey gas Cherenkov are enlarged and extend 10cm downstream due to its PMT readout size.
3. MRPC and FAEC are moved 10cm downstream also to accomodate the change
4. MRPC radius is changed to 96-210cm
5. FAEC radius is changed to 98-230cm, LAEC radius is changed to 83-140cm
6. Hexagon EC module layout, one layer half length module at inner radius
7. Virtual detector at entrance of real detector are larger, to prevent rerun the simulation if we decide to change or move the real detector. You need to make cut when evaluate rate!!!
8. EM background: collimater change
9. non-EM background: previously, "other" root file has all material krypotnite
Now, "actual" root file has all material same as EM background, in particular, target collimater is made of tungsten. Both target windows are studied also

event generator:
current event generator eicRate only produce events evenly distributed in phase space with individual rate per event
A modified private copy of event generator for hadron is at  /home/zwzhao/work_halla/solid/solid_svn/solid/evgen/eicRate_new/
It uses a two step process (creating crossection histgram, then throw events accordingly) to produce hadron. The "rate" in output is not used, a single normalization factor is determined by comparing the new result to old output. This should gives more accurate 
see Normalization below.
Normalization for EM background  (current/Nevent):  15e-6/1.6e-19/1e8
Normalization for hadron background:
	else if(Is_SIDIS_He3_window){
	  if (Is_pip) thisrate=134.;
	  if (Is_pim) thisrate=136.;
	  if (Is_pi0) thisrate=136.;	  
	  if (Is_Kp) thisrate=3.0;
	  if (Is_Km) thisrate=3.4;
	  if (Is_Ks || Is_Kl) thisrate=1.53;
	  if (Is_p) thisrate=23.;  
	}
	else if(Is_SIDIS_He3){
	  if (Is_pip) thisrate=241.;
	  if (Is_pim) thisrate=183.;
	  if (Is_pi0) thisrate=212.;  
	  if (Is_Kp) thisrate=5.9;
	  if (Is_Km) thisrate=3.7;
	  if (Is_Ks || Is_Kl) thisrate=2.4;
	  if (Is_p) thisrate=37.;  
	}

====== old_20130422 =============
change based on previous version

general:
all sensitive detector use prothreshold 0.01mm

EM background:
GEM use real material, first two gas gap are sensitive
cherenkov windows use real material
mrpc use  real material
thinner absorber

non-EM background:
fix the rate bug
medium vacuum 

====== old_20130321 =======
general:
use gemc 1.7 with geant4.9.5.p01 and QGSP_BERT_HP physics list
some file may not use prothreshold 0.01mm for sensitive detector

EM background:
use 11GeV electron on target with 15uA current
GEM use "GEMgas" only
0.04cm thick Al Cherenkov windows
mrpc is 1cm scintillator

non-EM background:
use all "kill" part, no secondary particle, medium maybe air
rate from eicRate
has a major BUG due to root tree by gemc_evio2root has one index higher than eicRate root tree, so all rate is wrong, this makes distribution more smeared. refer to compare.png for eDIS
