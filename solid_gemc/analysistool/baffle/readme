== get baffle == 
enter root, then run
.x makebaf5.C_zwzhao+

it requires solout_CLEO_LD2_120d_nobaf_11GeV.root at  http://hallaweb.jlab.org/12GeV/SoLID/download/baffle/
It outputs the baffle opening in terminal, (NOT baffle blocks)

== plot baffle ==

baffle_plot.C can plot baffle blocks
yu need to copy paste the baffle output from makebaf5.C into the code 

== get ApvErr ==
use  eDIS as input to run gemc with baffle to obtain root file
then enter root, run it like
pvdis_FOM.C("baffleCLEOv8_SCALEMIN1.4MAX1.4_cutinner.root")
