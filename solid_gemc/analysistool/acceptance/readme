shoot geantino(neutral) or chargedgeantino(positive) from target position over target length into SoLID and look for the hits on various detectors like EC and GEM, if there is a hit, this event is considered detected and the generated particle P and theta is recorded.

To test negative particle, use chargedgeantino and flip field by gemc option SCALE_FIELD="solenoid_CLEO, -1" 

in *.gcard
use "kill" type of solenoid, absorber, baffle etc which have material "Kryptonite" to make sure particles can get blocked.
use "thin" type of EC which has material "Kryptonite" and only a thin slice at front end. This is to avoid hits appear on both front and back end when "Kryptonite" is used. 

modify run_* and *.gcard to fit your program env and database you want to use.

run run_* to generate the evio, use gemc_evio2root to convert to root

use acceptance.C("gemc_rootfile") to plot and generate output rootfile

In the output root file, acceptance in P VS theta histograms are stored as
acceptance_0 GEM plane 1 
acceptance_1 GEM plane 2
acceptance_2 GEM plane 3
acceptance_3 GEM plane 4
acceptance_4 GEM plane 5
acceptance_5 GEM plane 6
acceptance_6 EC largeangle
acceptance_7 EC forwardangle
acceptance_8 CC lightgas
acceptance_9 CC heavygas

where P is from 0 to 11 GeV, 0.1GeV per bin, theta is from 0 to 50 degree, 0.2 degree per bin
