shoot geantino(neutral) or chargedgeantino(positive) from target position over target length into SoLID and look for the hits on various detectors like EC and GEM, if there is a hit, this event is considered detected and the generated particle P and theta is recorded.

To test negative particle, use chargedgeantino and flip field by gemc option SCALE_FIELD="solenoid_CLEO, -1" 

in *.gcard
use "kill" type of solenoid, absorber, baffle etc which have material "Kryptonite" to make sure particles can get blocked.
use virtualhodoscope in front of EC to see particle hits.
In the acceptace.C, there's a cut on the EC surface to determine if the EC can detect a particle with its tracjectory.

modify run_* and *.gcard to fit your program environment and database you want to use.

run run_* to generate the evio, use gemc_evio2root to convert to root

use acceptance.C("gemc_rootfile") to plot and generate output rootfile

In the output root file, acceptance in P VS theta histograms are stored as acceptance_largeangle and 
acceptance_forwardangle

where P is from 0 to 11 GeV, 0.1GeV per bin, theta is from 0 to 50 degree, 0.2 degree per bin
