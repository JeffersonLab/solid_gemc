based on gemc 2.9 inside jlabce:2.5 container 
not based on https://www.jlab.org/12gev_phys/packages/sources/gemc/gemc-2.9.tar.gz, which is slightly different

add some features to gemc
1. modify physics/PhysicsList.cc to allow hadron physics list only without EM physics list to run
2. modify fields/symmetries/*.cc,fields/mappedField.h to reduce field map mem use by using float instead of double
3. add link io to api/perl for perl script backward compatibility
4. modify src/dmesg_init.cc,gui/src/docs/particles_color.h,utilities/graph.cc,utilities/graph.h to fix particle colors

old files are kept as *_bak

compile it by "scons OPT=1 LIBRARY=shared -j8"
