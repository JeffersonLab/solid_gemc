== test NH3 target beam ==

This is to find where we should shoot beam into NH3 target field

NH3 field is a  solenoid along -x direction

the field holder and a virtual plane in "beam__geometry_Original.txt"

run "solid_gemc beam.gcard" which shoots 11GeV electron from origin backwards with reverse NH3 solenoid field, (or we could just use positron)

the output "beam.txt" has hit on the plane

avg_y and avg_z tells the position in mm, avg_y should be negative because the chicane design.

atan(py/pz) tells the theta angle in rad,

atan(py/px) tells the phi angle in rad, it should be 90 deg because NH3 solenoid field is along -x direction

modify beam.gcard a bit to include solid main solenoid field, the output "beam_withsolenoid.txt" has no change comparing to no solid main solenoid field case.
This is expected because solid main solenoid field should have no effect on a particle going along beamline.
