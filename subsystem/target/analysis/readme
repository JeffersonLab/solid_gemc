== test NH3 target beam ==

This is to find where we should shoot beam into NH3 target field

NH3 field is a  solenoid along +x direction

in "beam__geometry_Original.txt", the field holder and several planes 

run "solid_gemc beam.gcard" which shoots positron from origin at solenoid center backwards with reverse NH3 solenoid field/
change its beam energy to see different results

the output "beam.txt" has hit on the planes
avg_y and avg_z tells the position in mm, avg_y should be negative because the chicane design.
atan(py/pz) tells the theta angle in rad,
atan(py/px) tells the phi angle in rad, it should be 90 deg because NH3 solenoid field is along +x direction

A few beam settings "beam_*GeV.txt" are kept for the record
