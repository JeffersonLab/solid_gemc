Here is EC simulation using "solid_gemc"
It can work as standalone, but also with whole SoLID simulation, you just need to copy the files to the offical location at solid_gemc2/geometry/ec

=== How to use it ===
#make ec materials
./solid_ec_materials.pl config_solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle.dat

#generate ec geometry,output bank and hit processing
./solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle.pl config_solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle.dat

#run ec simulation
solid_gemc solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle.gcard

#convert evio2root file with solid_ec bank
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B=solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle -WRITE_RAWS=no

=== note ===
solid_ec_bank.pl defines output bank "solid_ec", it needs to exactly match hit processing routine in solid_ec_hitprocess.cc under solid_gemc2/source
Every time, you add or remove an entry, you need to modify the source code and recompile "solid_gemc" by following instruction there

solid_ec_hit.pl defines some general features of the hit processing

solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle_real.pl defines actual EC geometry
