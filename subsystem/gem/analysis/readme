Here is the files and scripts to run simulation and analysis results

It can work as standalone, but also test with other subsystems and full SoLID simulation

== run == 

#run gem simulation standalone
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_gem.gcard
solid_gemc solid_PVDIS_gem.gcard

#convert evio file in standalone simulation to root file
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B="../gem_solid_gemc/solid_SIDIS_gem" -W
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B="../gem_solid_gemc/solid_PVDIS_gem"
