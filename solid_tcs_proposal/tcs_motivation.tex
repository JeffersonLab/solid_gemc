In this section we describe the theory and phenomenology of the timelike
Compton process, discuss observables, and present model calculations. We
also explain how the data can be used in global fits, and show 6 GeV analysis
results.

\end{figure}

Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS), 
\begin{equation}
\gamma(q)+ p(p) \to \gamma^{\ast}(q^{\prime})+p(p^{\prime}) \,, 
\label{eq:TCS}
\end{equation}
is the process of photoproduction of a virtual timelike photon
($q^{{\prime} 2} = Q^{\prime 2} > 0$) on a nucleon. As shown in the right panel
of Fig.~\ref{fig:TCS_sketch}, the final-state virtual photon immediately decays
into a lepton pair. TCS is, however, not the only physical processes that can
be observed in exclusive photoproduction of lepton pairs,
$\gamma p \to l^{+} l^{-}p$. Another process with the same final state is the
purely electromagnetic Bethe-Heitler (BH) reaction shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BH}.
Like in DVCS, the TCS and BH amplitudes interfere. In JLab 12 GeV kinematics,
where the BH cross section is significantly larger than the TCS cross section,
one can take advantage of this interference to enhance the TCS signal;
see Sect.~\ref{subsec:observables} for details.

The TCS amplitude depends on the following three kinematic invariants:
\begin{eqnarray}
q^{{\prime} 2} &=& Q^{\prime 2} > 0 \,, \nonumber\\ 
s & = & (p+q)^2 \,, \nonumber\\
t & =& (p^{\prime}-p)^2 \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $q^{{\prime} 2} = Q^{\prime 2}$ is the virtuality of the final-state
photon, $s$ is the invariant photon-proton energy squared, and $t$ is the
four-momentum transfer squared.
In addition to these three variables, the $\gamma p \to l^{+} l^{-}p$ cross
section depends on the angles $\theta$ and $\varphi$ associated with the
final-state lepton pair. In the $l^{+} l^{-}$ center-of-mass frame, $\theta$
is the angle between the momenta of the lepton $\vec{k}$ and the recoiling
proton $\vec{q^{\prime}}$, and $\varphi$ is the angle between the reaction
plane and the lepton decay plane, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Angle}.

$\gamma p \to l^+ l^- p$ process.}}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Leading-twist formalism}
\label{subsec:leading_twist}

To ensure the applicability of the leading twist formalism to the
$\gamma p \to l^{+} l^{-}p$ process (the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:TCS_sketch}, one requires that 
(i) the timelike virtuality of the final-state photon, $Q^{\prime 2}$,
is sufficiently large to provide a hard scale,
(ii) the invariant photon-proton c.m. energy, $\sqrt{s}$, is sufficiently
large to ensure the usual DIS kinematics, and
(iii) the invariant momentum transfer squared $t$ is low, \textit{i.e.},
$|t| \leq 1$ GeV$^2$. 
The timelike nature of the final state also makes interpretation complicated
in the presence of resonances in the invariant mass of the produced lepton
pair. Hence, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ee_to_hadrons}, an ideal mass range for
this experiment is $M_{\rho^\prime} < M_{l^{+} l^{-}} < M_{J/\psi}$, which
coincides well with JLab 12 GeV kinematics.
Since the invariant mass of the lepton pair, $M_{l^{+} l^{-}}$, is also the
timelike virtuality of the outgoing photon, $Q^\prime$, focusing on the
resonance-free region automatically satisfies condition (i) above.

The leading-twist formalism for TCS has been developed in Ref.
\cite{Berger:2001xd}. It is based on the factorization theorem
\cite{Collins:1998be} that allows one to express the TCS amplitude in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:TCS}) as convolutions of calculable hard-scattering kernels
with GPDs. The resulting quantities are called Compton form factors (CFFs).
One expects that as long as $Q^{\prime 2}$ is sufficiently large, the
leading-twist approximation (\textit{i.e.}, ignoring terms of the order
of $m_N^2/Q^{\prime 2}$, $m_l^2/Q^{\prime 2}$, and $|t|/Q^{\prime 2}$)
should work equally well for TCS as it does for DVCS. In other words,
one does not expect enhanced higher twist corrections specific to
TCS~\cite{Diehl:2003ny}.

To leading order in the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, the TCS amplitude
is given by the two handbag diagrams presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:TCS_Handbag}.
To leading order in $\alpha_s$, the TCS amplitude is equivalent to the
DVCS amplitude, making it easier to test the universality of GPDs.
However, at the next-to-leading order, the expressions for the hard scattering
kernels for TCS and DVCS are different and, as a result, the TCS and DVCS CFFs
have different forms \cite{Pire:2011st,Pire:2012yq}. This is discussed further
in Sect.~\ref{subsec:NLO}.

The proton has four leading-twist parton-helicity non-flip quark GPDs. The
expressions for the corresponding CFFs, ${\cal H}_1$, ${\cal E}_1$,
${\tilde{\cal H}}_1$, and $\tilde{{\cal E}}_1$ are:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal H}_1(\eta,t) &= &\sum_q e_q^2 \int^{1}_{-1} \left(\frac{H^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta-x+i \epsilon}
  -\frac{H^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta+x+i \epsilon}\right) \,, \nonumber\\
{\cal E}_1(\eta,t) &= &\sum_q e_q^2 \int^{1}_{-1} \left(\frac{E^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta-x+i \epsilon}
  -\frac{H^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta+x+i \epsilon}\right) \,, \nonumber\\
\tilde{{\cal H}}_1(\eta,t) &= &\sum_q e_q^2 \int^{1}_{-1} \left(\frac{\tilde{H}^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta-x+i \epsilon} +\frac{\tilde{H}^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta+x+i \epsilon}\right) \,, \nonumber\\
\tilde{{\cal E}}_1(\eta,t) &= &\sum_q e_q^2 \int^{1}_{-1} \left(\frac{\tilde{E}^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta-x+i \epsilon} +\frac{\tilde{E}^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta+x+i \epsilon}\right) \,,
\label{eq:CFF_H1}
\end{eqnarray}
where the superscript $q$ denotes the quark flavor and $e_q$ the quark charge.
For brevity, we suppressed the $Q^2$-dependence of the GPDs and CFFs.
In Eq.~(\ref{eq:CFF_H1}), the light-cone fraction $\eta$, which in TCS plays
the role of the skewness $\xi$ in DVCS, is fixed by the external kinematics:
\begin{equation}
\eta=-\frac{(q-q^{\prime}) \cdot (q+q^{\prime})}{(p+p^{\prime}) \cdot (q+q^{\prime})} \approx \frac{Q^{\prime 2}}{2(s-M^2)-Q^{\prime 2}+t} \,.
\label{eq:eta}
\end{equation} 

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Angle.eps}
\caption{\small{Momenta and angles involved in the TCS cross section in the
$\gamma p$ and $l^{+} l^{-}$ center-of-mass frames. Adopted from
\cite{Berger:2001xd}. Note that the angles $\varphi$ and $\theta$ will be
referred to explicitly as $\varphi_{CM}$ and $\theta_{CM}$ outside of the
motivation section to avoid confusion with the angles in the lab system.}}
\label{fig:Angle}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

From Eq.~(\ref{eq:CFF_H1}) it follows that the imaginary part of the CFFs can
be expressed in terms of GPDs along the so-called cross-over line,
\textit{i.e.}, at $x=\eta$ for quarks and $x=-\eta$ for antiquarks. The real
part of the CFFs is, on the other hand, sensitive to GPDs over the entire range
of $x$. For instance, the real part of the CFF ${\cal H}_1$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Re e {\cal H}_1(\eta,t) = \sum_q e_q^2 \, p.v.\int^{1}_{-1} \left(\frac{H^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta-x}
  -\frac{H^q (x,\eta,t)}{\eta+x}\right) \,,
\label{eq:ReH1}
\end{equation}
where $p.v.$ stands for the principal value. The straightforward access to
the real part of CFFs (see Sect.~\ref{subsec:observables}) gives TCS
measurements the potential to constrain GPDs away from the cross-over line
in a wide range of $x$ and $\eta$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=125mm]{ee_to_hadrons.eps}
\caption{\small{Measurements of $e^+e^-$ annihilation into hadrons show a
resonance-free window between the $\rho'$ and the $J/\psi$, which is ideal
for TCS studies at 12 GeV.}}
\label{fig:ee_to_hadrons}
\end{figure}

The imaginary part of the Compton amplitude is now relatively well understood,
primarily through measurements of DVCS -- see, \textit{e.g.},
\cite{Guidal:2013rya}. However, much less is known about
the real part, which may become important at larger values of $x$, coinciding
with JLab 12 GeV kinematics.
The limited knowledge of the real part of the amplitude is reflected in GPD
model predictions, which are in good general agreement for the imaginary part,
but differ significantly when it comes to the real one. This is illustrated
in Figs.~\ref{fig:ReImH_tau} and \ref{fig:ReImH_t}, which show the real and
imaginary parts of the GPD $H$ as a function of $x$ and $-t$, respectively,
for two GPD models: the dual parametrization
\cite{Polyakov:2002wz,Guzey:2006xi,Guzey:2008ys,Polyakov:2008aa} and the
double distribution~\cite{Radyushkin:1998es}.
The potential of TCS to provide additional constraints on the real part
of CFFs is thus important for developing more accurate GPD models. The
TCS data could also be used in global fits of CFFs and for dispersion
relation analysis. This is discussed in more detail in
Sect.~\ref{subsec:amplitude_analysis} and
Sect.~\ref{subsec:dispersion}, respectively.

In TCS, the use of a circularly polarized photons allows to determinate
both the real and imaginary parts of the helicity amplitudes or CFFs
with comparable uncertainties. In contrast, DVCS measurements strongly
favor the imaginary part. The real part is only available through direct
cross section measurements or comparisons of cross sections measured
with electron and positron beams, both of which are significantly more
challenging than, for instance, the measurement of beam spin asymmetries
that give access to the imaginary part.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{TCS_Handbag.epsi}
\caption{\small{The handbag diagrams for TCS. The plus-momentum fractions
refer to the average proton momentum $(p+p^{\prime})/2$.}}
\label{fig:TCS_Handbag}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In addition to discriminating between GPD models and constraining fits of
CFFs, a measurement of TCS may also offer a unique possibility to address
the issue of the so-called $D$-term~\cite{Polyakov:1999gs}.
Technically, the $D$-term is defined as the contribution to the GPD $H$ and
$E$ that provides the highest power of $\xi$ in Mellin moments of this GPD.
The $D$-term of the GPD $E$ has the same magnitude but opposite sign.
The $D$-term contribution to GPDs has support only in the region
$x \in [-\eta,\eta]$, which makes it elusive and inaccessible in the forward
limit. This unambiguously indicates that the $D$-term cannot be interpreted
in terms of the usual parton densities. Instead, the $D$-term describes the
emission of a $q {\bar q}$ pair by the nucleon, revealing the complex nature 
of the nucleon as a many-body system.

The $D$-term~\cite{Polyakov:1999gs} was originally introduced in
the context of the double distribution (DD) parametrization of GPDs
\cite{Radyushkin:1998es}, as an additional function required to generate the 
highest $n+1$ power of $xi$ in the $x^n$ moment of the GPD $H(x, xi)$. It was
realized \cite{Belitsky:2000vk} that the s]ame result could be achieved within
a single-DD parameterization (\textit{i.e.}, one using only the forward parton
distributions as input), but at the price of introducing singular expressions
requiring additional prescriptions. Because of the need to deal with singular
functions this method was not widely used for modeling GPDs. However, a
recent theoretical analysis of the single-DD parametrization
\cite{Radyushkin:2011dh} demonstrated explicity how all arising singular
expressions can be regularized and how the $D$-term naturally appears in
this approach, so that the relation between the two parametrizations is now
well understood. Coupled with the imbedded Regge formalism, the single-DD 
parametrization thus offers a new alternative approach to modeling GPDs.

The distribution of energy, momentum, and angular momentum in the nucleon
is characterized by form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor between
the nucleon states~\cite{Ji:1996ek,Jaffe:1989jz}, all of which can be
expressed in terms of GPDs. The $D$-term gives rise to one of these form
factors (denoted $C(t)$ or $d_1(t)$ in the literature).

It has been shown that in the Breit frame, this form factor can
be interpreted as describing the distribution of pressure and shear forces
acting on quarks inside the nucleon~\cite{Polyakov:2002yz}. Studies in
field-theoretical models show that the negative sign of the $D$-term is a
consequence of the stability of the nucleon~\cite{Goeke:2007fp}. This is
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:D_term}, where the pressure $p(r)$ experienced
by quarks inside the nucleon is given as a function of the distance from the
center, $r$. Stability arises as a balance between repulsive forces in the
inner region, and attractive forces at large $r$, such that the stability
condition $\int_0^\infty {\rm d}r\,r^2p(r)=0$ holds.
The $D$-term is given by $d_1=5\pi M \int_0^\infty{\rm d}r\,r^4p(r)$ and the
additional weight $r^2$ in the integrand emphasizes the role of large
distances and binding forces inside the nucleon, leading to a negative
value of the $D$-term~\cite{Goeke:2007fp}.

Form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor can also be calculated from
first principles in lattice QCD. The QCDSF collaboration calculated the
$D$-term form factor $d_1(t)$ as a function of $-t$ for the pion
mass $m_{\pi}=640$ MeV~\cite{Gockeler:2003jfa}. The predictions of the chiral
quark-soliton model~\cite{Goeke:2007fp} used for the calculation shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:D_term} are in agreement with the lattice data.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{comp_DD_Dual_Q2_5.eps}

\caption{\small{Imaginary (left) and real (right) parts of the GPD $H$

The curves correspond to GPD models based on the dual parametrization
\cite{Polyakov:2002wz,Guzey:2006xi,Guzey:2008ys,Polyakov:2008aa} and the
double distribution~\cite{Radyushkin:1998es}, respectively.}}
\label{fig:ReImH_tau}
\end{figure}

The notion of the $D$-term is
%fundamental to two-photon processes, and is also
important for phenomenology because it
(i) is an integral ingredient of GPD modeling (see the discussion above),
(ii) gives an energy-independent ($\eta$-independent) contribution to
$\Re e H_1$ and $\Re e E_1$, and 
(iii) determines the subtraction constant in the dispersion relation
connecting the real and imaginary parts of the TCS and DVCS amplitudes
\cite{Radyushkin:2011dh,Anikin:2007yh,Diehl:2007jb,Polyakov:2007rv}.
In the language of Regge theory
\cite{Brodsky:1971zh,Brodsky:1972vv,Brodsky:1973hm,Brodsky:2008qu},
the $D$-term can be interpreted as originating from the $t$-channel
exchange with $J=0$ (the so-called fixed pole).


\subsection{TCS cross section and interference between TCS and BH amplitudes}
\label{subsec:observables}

\begin{figure}[t]

equivalent of $\xi$ in DVCS. The curves show the same models as in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ReImH_tau}.}}
\label{fig:ReImH_t}
\end{figure}

In the leading-twist approximation, the TCS cross section has
the following form~\cite{Berger:2001xd}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \sigma_{\rm TCS}}{dQ^{\prime 2} \,dt\, d cos \theta \, d \varphi} \approx \frac{\alpha^3_{\rm em}}{ 8 \pi s^2} \frac{1}{Q^{\prime 2}} \frac{1+\cos^2 \theta}{4} \sum_{\lambda,\lambda^{\prime}}
|M^{\lambda^{\prime}-,\lambda-}|^2 \,,
\label{eq:sigma_tcs}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{\rm em}$ is the fine structure constant and
$M^{\lambda^{\prime}-,\lambda-}$ are helicity amplitudes, with $\lambda$
($\lambda^{\prime}$) denoting the helicity of the incoming (outgoing) photon.
The TCS amplitude squared entering Eq.~(\ref{eq:sigma_tcs}) is expressed in
terms of the Compton form factors:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\lambda,\lambda^{\prime}}|M^{\lambda^{\prime}-,\lambda-}|^2
&=(1-\eta^2)(|{\cal H}_1|^2+|\tilde{{\cal H}}_1|^2)-2 \eta^2 Re ({\cal H}_1^{\ast} {\cal E}_1+\tilde{{\cal H}}_1^{\ast} \tilde{{\cal E}}_1) 
\nonumber\\
&-(\eta^2+\frac{t}{4 m_N^2}) |{\cal E}_1|^2-\eta^2 \frac{t}{4 m_N^2} 
|\tilde{{\cal E}}_1|^2 \,.
\label{eq:m_tcs}
\end{align}

Theoretical analyses~\cite{Berger:2001xd,Pire:2008ea} have shown that the
TCS cross section is smaller than the BH cross section for JLab 12 GeV
kinematics, but like in DVCS, the BH and TCS amplitudes also interfere.
When the initial-state photon is unpolarized,
the interference term can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{d\sigma_{\rm INT}}{dQ^{\prime 2}\, dt\, d(\cos\theta)\, d\varphi}
&=& {}- \frac{\alpha^3_{\rm em}}{4\pi s^2}\, \frac{1}{-t}\, \frac{M}{Q^{\prime}}\,
 \frac{1}{\tau \sqrt{1-\tau}}\, \frac{L_0}{L}
 \nonumber \\
&& {}\times\, \Big[\, \cos\varphi\, \frac{1+\cos^2\theta}{\sin\theta}\, \Re e \tilde{M}^{--}
   - \cos2\varphi\, \sqrt{2}\cos\theta\, \Re e \tilde{M}^{0-}
 \nonumber \\
&& {}+\, \cos3\varphi\, \sin\theta\, \Re e \tilde{M}^{+-}
   {}+\, {\cal O}\Big( \frac{1}{Q^{\prime}} \Big) \Big] \,,
\label{eq:interference}
\end{eqnarray}
where $M$ is the proton mass. The variable $\tau$,
\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{Q^{\prime 2}}{2 (p \cdot q)}=\frac{Q^{\prime 2}}{s-M^2} \,,
\label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}
in TCS is the analog of the Bjorken variable $x_B=Q^2/(2 p \cdot q)$ in DVCS. 
To leading twist accuracy,
\begin{equation}
\eta=\frac{\tau}{2-\tau} \,,
\end{equation}   
where $\eta$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:eta}).
In Eq.~(\ref{eq:interference}), $L_0$ and $L$ originate from the product of
final-state lepton propagators~\cite{Berger:2001xd} and
$\tilde{M}^{\mu^{\prime} \mu}$ are interference helicity amplitudes, where
$\mu$ ($\mu^{\prime}$) denotes the helicity of the incoming (outgoing) photon.
%While $\tilde{M}^{--}$ is a leading twist amplitude, $\tilde{M}^{0-}$ and 
%$\tilde{M}^{+-}$ are higher twist amplitudes.
In the handbag approximation, the photon (parton) helicity is conserved and,
as a result, the only surviving contribution in Eq.~(\ref{eq:interference})
comes from $\tilde{M}^{--}$:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{M}^{--}=\frac{2 \sqrt{t_0-t}}{M} \frac{1-\eta}{1+\eta} \Big[F_1 {\cal H}_1
-\eta(F_1+F_2)\tilde{{\cal H}}_1-\frac{t}{4 M^2} F_2 {\cal E}_1 \Big] \,,
\label{eq:M}
\end{equation}
where $-t_0=4 \eta^2 M^2/(1-\eta^2)$ is the minimal momentum transfer at a
given $\eta$ (modulo $1/Q^{\prime 2}$ corrections), and $F_1$ and $F_2$ are
the Dirac and Pauli elastic form factors of the proton, respectively.

in the framework of the chiral quark-soliton model~\cite{Goeke:2007fp}.}}
\label{fig:D_term}
\end{figure}

Unpolarized photons (from a helicity-averaged electron beam) give access
to the real part of the CFFs. With a longitudinally polarized electron beam,
producing circularly polarized photons with polarization $\nu \neq 0$, one
can simultaneously study both the real and imaginary parts of the helicity
amplitudes using the full expression for the interference
term~\cite{Berger:2001xd}:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{d\sigma_{\rm INT}}{dQ^{\prime 2}\, dt\, d(\cos\theta)\, d\varphi}
&=& {}- \frac{\alpha^3_{em}}{4\pi s^2}\, \frac{1}{-t}\, \frac{M}{Q^{\prime}}\,
 \frac{1}{\tau \sqrt{1-\tau}}\, \frac{L_0}{L}
 \nonumber \\
&& {}\times\, \Big(\,\Big[\, \cos\varphi\, \frac{1+\cos^2\theta}{\sin\theta}\, \Re e\tilde{M}^{--}
   - \cos2\varphi\, \sqrt{2}\cos\theta\, \Re e \tilde{M}^{0-}
 \nonumber \\
&& {}+\, \cos3\varphi\, \sin\theta\, \Re e \tilde{M}^{+-}
   {}+\, {\cal O}\Big( \frac{1}{Q^{\prime}} \Big) \Big]
 \nonumber \\
&& {}+\, \nu\; \Big[\, \sin\varphi\, \frac{1+\cos^2\theta}{\sin\theta}\, \im\tilde{M}^{--}
   - \sin2\varphi\, \sqrt{2}\cos\theta\, \Im m\tilde{M}^{0-}
 \nonumber \\
&& {}+\, \sin3\varphi\, \sin\theta\, \im\tilde{M}^{+-} +\, {\cal O}\Big( \frac{1}{Q^{\prime}} \Big) \Big]\, \Big) \; ,
\label{eq:interference_2}
\end{eqnarray}
%Thus, measurements of TCS with polarized beams have the potential to
%constrain both the real and imaginary parts of the CFFs.

note the while the different integration contour changes the absolute value of
$R'$ compared with $R$, it does not diminish the sensitivity.}}
\label{fig:r_theory}
\end{figure}

Under charge conjugation of the final-state lepton pair, which corresponds to
the transformation $\varphi \to \varphi + \pi$, the TCS and BH cross sections
are even, while the interference term is odd. This makes it possible to
project out the TCS-BH interference through the weighted and
$\theta$-integrated cross
section~\cite{Berger:2001xd}:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{dS}{dQ^{\prime 2}\, dt\, d\varphi} = 
  \int_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4} d\theta\;
  \frac{L(\theta,\varphi)}{L_0(\theta)}\,
  \frac{d\sigma}{dQ^{\prime 2}\, dt\, d\theta\,d\varphi} \,.
%  \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\, \cos(n\varphi) \,.
\label{eq:S}
\end{equation}
The contribution of, for instance, $\Re e\tilde{M}^{--}$, can now be obtained
by taking the $\cos \varphi$-moment of $S$~\cite{Berger:2001xd}:
\begin{equation}
 R = \frac{\displaystyle 2 \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi\, \cos\varphi\, \frac{dS}{dQ^{\prime 2}\, dt\, d\varphi}}
          {\displaystyle \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi\, \frac{dS}{dQ^{\prime 2}\, dt\, d\varphi}} \,.
\label{eq:R}
\end{equation}

An example of the calculation of $R$ as a function of $-t$ at a fixed
initial-state photon energy $E_{\gamma}=7.8$ GeV and $Q^{\prime 2} = 5$
GeV$^2$ is shown in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:r_theory}.
%As in Fig.~\ref{fig:ReImH_t},
The curves show predictions of calculations
based on two GPD models: the dual parametrization
\cite{Polyakov:2002wz,Guzey:2006xi,Guzey:2008ys,Polyakov:2008aa} (upper curve)
and the double distribution~\cite{Radyushkin:1998es} (lower three curves).
The difference in the magnitude of $R$ is quite significant, as would be
expected given the difference in $\Re e H$ shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ReImH_t}.
The three lower curves correspond to different strengths of the
$D$-term~\cite{Goeke:2001tz} in the double distribution, as quantified by the
parameter $\kappa$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dd1}).
It is interesting to note that for the standard value of $\kappa$, the double
distribution predicts a cancellation with the $D$-term resulting in a small
$\Re e H$ -- a feature absent in the dual parametrization.
The right panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:r_theory} shows the same calculations
performed within the $\theta$-$\varphi$ acceptance of the detector.
The details are explained in Sect.~\ref{sec:rates}.
In the calculations with the double distribution, for the GPD $H$ we used:
\begin{equation}
H^q(x,\eta,t)=\int^1_{-1} d\beta \int^{1-|\beta|}_{-1+|\beta|} d \alpha \delta(x-\beta-\alpha \eta) \pi(|\beta|,\alpha) q(\beta,t)+ \kappa \frac{1}{N_f}\Theta(\eta-|x|) D(x/\eta,t)
\,,
\label{eq:dd1}
\end{equation}
where $\pi(\beta,\alpha)$ is the profile function that determines the degree
of skewness, $q(\beta,t)$ is the off-diagonal quark parton distribution that
reduces to the usual parton distribution in the $t=0$ limit, $D(x/\eta,t)$ is
the $D$-term, and $N_f=3$ is the number of active quark flavors. Note that we
introduced the coefficient $\kappa$ in front of the $D$-term to vary the
strength of its contribution. For the $D$-term, we used the standard expansion
in terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials $C_n^{3/2}$: 
\begin{equation}
D(z,t=0)=-(1-z^2)(d_1\, C_1^{3/2}(z)+d_3\, C ^{3/2}(z)+d_5\, C ^{3/2}(z)) \,.
\label{eq:D_term}
\end{equation}
The magnitude of the coefficients $d_i$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:D_term}) was estimated
in the chiral quark-soliton model at a low normalization scale
\cite{Petrov:1998kf}; QCD evolution to the needed values of $Q^{\prime 2}$
somewhat decreases the values of the coefficients~\cite{Diehl:2003ny}.
To test the sensitivity of $R$ the $D$-term, we varied the parameter $\kappa$.
The three curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:r_theory} correspond to $\kappa=0.5$ (lower
curve), $\kappa=1$ (standard magnitude of the $D$-term), and $\kappa=2$
(upper curve), respectively.

\subsection{Comment on dispersion analysis}
\label{subsec:dispersion}

Dispersion relations provide a very powerful and model-independent method
to relate the real and imaginary parts of scattering amplitudes based on
such general properties as analyticity and crossing symmetry. For hard
exclusive reactions, dispersion relations have been established and analyzed
for DVCS, double DVCS (where the incoming photon has a spacelike virtuality
and the outgoing photon is timelike), and for exclusive meson
production~\cite{Anikin:2007yh,Diehl:2007jb,Polyakov:2007rv}.

For instance, for the CFF ${\cal H}^{q[+]}$ (the superscript $[+]$
indicates the singlet combination corresponding to $q+{\bar q}$), 
one obtains the dispersion relation~\cite{Diehl:2007jb}:
\begin{equation}
\Re e {\cal H}^{q[+]}(\xi)=\frac{1}{\pi} \int^{\infty}_{1} d\omega \Im m C^{q[+]}(\omega) \int^{1}_{-1}dx \Bigg\{H^q(x,\frac{x}{\omega})\Big[\frac{1}{\omega \xi -x}-\frac{1}{\omega \xi+x}\Big]+\frac{2 D^q(x)}{\omega-x} \Bigg\} \,,
\label{eq:DR}
\end{equation}
where $C^{q[+]}$ is the process-dependent hard-scattering kernel.
The $D$-term enters the dispersion relation as a subtraction constant,
\textit{i.e.}, it gives an energy-independent contribution to
$\Re e {\cal H}^{q[+]}$.
The importance of the dispersion relation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:DR}) 
is that it quantifies the amount of information on GPDs that can be 
extracted from the real and imaginary parts of CFFs or, more generally, 
from amplitudes of exclusive processes. In addition, it provides a
practical consistency check for models of GPDs.
While dispersion relations for the TCS amplitudes have not yet been worked
out, there should be no major difficulty in establishing them analogously
to the cases that have already been considered.
%The analytic structure of the TCS amplitude is
%richer than that of the DVCS amplitude because the timelike virtuality 
%$Q^{\prime 2}$ leads to simultaneous branch cuts in $s$ and $Q^{\prime 2}$.
%Prospects to measure TCS will enhance the interest in and need for dispersion
%relations for the TCS amplitude, and such relations will be established.
