generate detector description 
cc_pro.pl config_cc_pro.dat

for different gas, change "$material_gas", $material_pmt_surface in cc_pro_geometry.pl
for location, change $Ang_chamber, $Zmin_chamber in cc_pro_geometry.pl
and change "variation" in config_cc_pro.dat  

do this for interactive with graphic
solid_gemc cc_pro.gcard

do this for batch 
solid_gemc cc_pro_batch.gcard

convert evio to root, the bank is "solid_hgc"
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B="cc_pro"

analysis result
