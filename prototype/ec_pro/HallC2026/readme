simulation for beamtest in HallC 2026

=geometry details ==
"cc_pro_tcd" is a virtual mother volume and all detector should be its daughters
for "cc_pro_tcd" location, change $AngY_tcd (angle relative to beam direction) , $rmin_chamber (cc tank front window relative to target center) in cc_pro_tcd_geometry.pl and in cc_pro_geometry.pl
for different gas in Cherenkov, change "$material_gas", $material_pmt_surface in cc_pro_geometry.pl
give different "variation" for various different geometry

= run simulation =====
refer to running simulationin container at https://github.com/JeffersonLab/solid_release/blob/master/howto.md

create or update geometry
cd geometry
./beamline.pl config.dat
./cc_pro_tcd.pl config.dat
./cc_pro.pl config.dat
./solid_spd.pl config.dat
./solid_gem.pl config.dat
./solid_ec.pl config.dat
then rename output text file with proper variation

run with graphic
cd analysis
solid_gemc hallc2026.gcard

run without graphic
solid_gemc hallc2026_batch.gcard -BEAM_P="e-,3*GeV,18*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,0)cm" -N=1e2

convert to root file
evio2root -INPUTF=out_even.evio -B="../geometry/cc_pro ../geometry/solid_ec ../geometry/solid_gem ../geometry/solid_spd" -R="flux"

exit container
ctrl-d or exit

note
adding the big beamline cad into simulation will slow down simulation running by about 100 times

= analysis result =====
(do this outside of the container)
module use /group/halla/modulefiles
module load root
cd analysis
root 'analysis.C+("out.root")'
