geometry
"cc_pro_tcd" is virtual mother volume, all detector should be its daughter
for "cc_pro_tcd" location, change $AngY_tcd, $rmin_chamber in cc_pro_geometry.pl and change "variation" in config_cc_pro.dat
for different gas in Cherenkov, change "$material_gas", $material_pmt_surface in cc_pro_geometry.pl and change "variation" in config_cc_pro.dat

do this for interactive with graphic
solid_gemc hallc2022.gcard

convert evio to root, the bank is "solid_hgc"
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B="cc_pro,solid_gem"
