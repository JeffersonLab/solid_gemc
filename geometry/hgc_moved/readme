Here is HGC simulation setup using "solid_gemc" which is the SoLID simulation program based on GEMC

The setup gives a complete definition of the detector.

detector definition are in text files.
It include geometry and sensitivity,material,mirror,hit,bank definition.
The perl scripts is are producde these text files
Except the parameter text file has all external parameter, it is edit by hand.

A perl script will call other perl scripts and use parameter file to produce all other texts by running command below
source your set_solid
./solid_SIDIS_hgc.pl config_solid_SIDIS_hgc.dat

The hit definition, bank definitions and corresponding hit processing routine "solid_hgc" of "solid_gemc" have to match to produce meaningful result.
Any change in hit definition and bank definition, you need to modify the source code "solid_hgc" accordingly and recompile "solid_gemc" by following instruction there
