To produce ec text files, scripts run slightly differently than typical gemc detector construction. 
We use one standard config.dat, then specify detector name as option as follow
./solid_ec.pl solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle
./solid_ec.pl solid_SIDIS_ec_forwardangle
./solid_ec.pl solid_SIDIS_ec_largeangle

layout according to ANL design for ec_forwardangle in "analysis/ec_layout"
each module is according to ANL drawing "200318"

ANL ec_layout has 1749 modules
Actual layout is determined by choosing only modules with Rmin and Rmax according to acceptance.
The resulting number of modules are as follows
                                N of modules    Rmin(cm)     Rmax(cm)
solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle     1697            95           240
solid_SIDIS_ec_forwardangle     1413            100          265
solid_SIDIS_ec_largeangle       307             83           137
