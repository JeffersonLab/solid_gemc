To produce ec text files, scripts run slightly differently than typical gemc detector construction. 
We use one standard config.dat, then specify detector name as option as follow
./solid_ec.pl solid_PVDIS_ec_forwardangle
./solid_ec.pl solid_SIDIS_ec_forwardangle
./solid_ec.pl solid_SIDIS_ec_largeangle

layout according to ANL design for ec_forwardangle in "analysis/ec_layout"
module according to ANL drawing "200318"
