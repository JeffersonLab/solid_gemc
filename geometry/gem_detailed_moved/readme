assumption
1. GEM layers have no change (total thickness 15.525mm)
2. GEM pos Z has no change as in preCDR and it defines GEM plane center
3. remove PVDIS small sector offset
4. sector 1 edge starts from phi=90deg (along y-axis), then sector number increase as phi increases
5. GEM frame as thick as GEM and is made of kapton
6. GEM plane Rin is defined by GEM inner edge
7. for SIDIS with overlapping sectors, odd sectors are at front, even sectors are at back. GEM pos Z is for front sector center. the distance between front and back is 10mm, so the total thickess of a plane is 15.525+10+15.525=41.05mm
8. spacer ????
