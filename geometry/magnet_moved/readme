this dir is for longer endcap magnet, while "../magnet" is for shorter endcap

To produce solenoid cryo text file, run this
./solid_solenoid_cryo_geometry.pl config_solid_solenoid_cryo.dat

To produce solenoid text files, scripts run slightly differently than typical gemc detector construction. 
We use one standard config.dat, then specify detector name as option as follow
./solid_solenoid.pl v4

solid_solenoid_v0_geometry.pl 
longer endcap magnet as a copy and paste of shorter magnet from "../magnet/solid_solenoid_geometry.pl", then make endcap longer by 45cm

longer endcap magnet modeled after info in appendix of Jay Benesch's notes, refer to ../../field/readme
solid_solenoid_v2_geometry.pl 
solid_solenoid_v3_geometry.pl 
solid_solenoid_v4_geometry.pl
