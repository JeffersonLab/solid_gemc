this dir is for longer endcap magnet, while "../magnet" is for shorter endcap

solid_solenoid_v0_geometry.pl 
longer endcap magnet as a copy and paste of shorter magnet from "../magnet/solid_solenoid_geometry.pl", then make endcap longer by 45cm

solid_solenoid_v2_geometry.pl 
longer endcap magnet modeled after info in appendix of Jay Benesch's magnet model with "SoLID_2020.pdf" in 2020/03 which matches field map of "fields/solenoid_v2.dat"
this geant4 geometry use cylinder to replace inner and outer octagon for simplicity and add cryostat

v1
cad model "solid_solenoid_v1.stl" is the same as "SoLID_CLEO_MAR_18_v1.0.stl"

v2
cad model "solid_solenoid_v2.stl" is the same as "SoLID_Iron_Oct20_Update_v2.0.stl"
