this dir is for longer endcap magnet, while "../magnet" is for shorter endcap

solid_solenoid_cryo_geometry.pl
the cryostat of CLEO magnet

solid_solenoid_v0_geometry.pl 
longer endcap magnet as a copy and paste of shorter magnet from "../magnet/solid_solenoid_geometry.pl", then make endcap longer by 45cm

solid_solenoid_v2_geometry.pl 
longer endcap magnet modeled after info in appendix of Jay Benesch's magnet model with "SoLID_2020.pdf" in 2020/03 which matches field map of "field/solenoid_v2.dat" and 

solid_solenoid_v3_geometry.pl 
longer endcap magnet modeled after info in appendix of Jay Benesch's magnet model with "SoLID_2020vs2022.pdf" in 2022/03 which matches field map of "field/solenoid_v3.dat" and 

cad model "v1_cad/SoLID_CLEO_MAR_18_v1.0.stl" 

cad model "v2_cad/SoLID_Iron_Oct20_Update_v2.0_vc.stl"
