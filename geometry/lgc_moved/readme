Script runs slightly differently than typical gemc detector construction.  INSTEAD of loading a standard config-file, instead one needs to load a config file specified in the "configs" directory.

For example: 
"./solid_lgc.pl configs/pvdis_CLEO_extZ_smallAng.pl"  should load a version of the PVDIS
"./solid_lgc.pl configs/sidis_CLEO_extZ_smallAng.pl"  should load a version of the SIDIS

The typical config file (lg_cherenkov.config) is loaded by default where the variables are defined.

You will need the Math::MatrixReal and Math::VectorReal perl packages to run the geometry construction.  You can install them by yum or using cpan, which is typically painless.  See http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for more info.
