This is an example of how to build against GEMC which has been compiled as a
shared object library.  

Because GEMC is usually not build this way, one must first compile it from 
source with a modification to the SConstruct file.  Because the build system 
was ported using scons, it's actually trivial to do this.  From the included
GEMC SConstruct file, add an additional line copied from the main build Program
line:

Target = 'gemc'
env.Program(source = gemc_sources + phys_sources + hitp_sources + output_sources, target = Target)

to

Target = 'gemc'
env.Program(source = gemc_sources + phys_sources + hitp_sources + output_sources, target = Target)
env.SharedLibrary(source = gemc_sources + phys_sources + hitp_sources + output_sources, target = Target)

This will build libgemc.so

Once this is built you must do two things:

Make sure that GEMC is set to the path that contains libgemc.so
Make sure that PYTHONPATH points to where the GEMC scons_scripts live

You should then be able to build what is here, which add on to what GEMC has
