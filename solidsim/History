	Set up framework for some of the classes.  The code compiles
	but doesn't do anything.  This builds against ROOT so all
	it's classes are available to use.

Dec 22, 2010 - Seamus
	Python bindings incorporated and a Python interpreter runs
	in the geometry construction class.  Worked out the base
	interface for data getting written to the ROOT tree as well
	as a sensitive detector that records the hits (though I think
	the position and momentum components aren't getting read out
	correctly.

	Makefiles updated to build everything.  The Python libraries
	are built.  We need to use our own version of the Python 
	libraries that don't initialize a visualization manager, so
	a script that takes what we need and modifies it is included.
	This also allows us to make any further changes to the bindings
	if we want.

	Added an example of how to build a geometry and add detectors
	is included.

	Added in a simple physics list and particle gun for testing
	purposes.

	Messenger interfaces are not written.  Documentation needs more
	work well.
