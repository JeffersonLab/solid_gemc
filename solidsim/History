	Set up framework for some of the classes.  The code compiles
	but doesn't do anything.  This builds against ROOT so all
	it's classes are available to use.

	Python bindings incorporated and a Python interpreter runs
	in the geometry construction class.  Worked out the base
	interface for data getting written to the ROOT tree as well
	as a sensitive detector that records the hits (though I think
	the position and momentum components aren't getting read out
	correctly.

	Makefiles updated to build everything.  The Python libraries
	are built.  We need to use our own version of the Python 
	libraries that don't initialize a visualization manager, so
	a script that takes what we need and modifies it is included.
	This also allows us to make any further changes to the bindings
	if we want.

	Added an example of how to build a geometry and add detectors
	is included.

	Added in a simple physics list and particle gun for testing
	purposes.

	Messenger interfaces are not written.  Documentation needs more
	work well.

Jan 6, 2011 - Seamus
	Fixed some of the Python compilation stuff.  It should now 
	build for arbitrary (mostly sane) systems.

	Added in a bunch of useful stuff.  Fixed the ROOT output to
	get the momentum and position components right.  Added in 
	a reasonable system for magnetic fields, since the python
	bindings don't seem to be fully supported in what we need.
	This is done in SolidSimpleField.  Waiting to get sample maps
	from both the TOSCA and POISSON crowds.

	Put in more messaging interfaces.  Still need to do the
	primary generation and physics lists.  Selective output into
	the ROOT trees is working.

	Output for generic detectors includes all hits, hits from
	unique tracks (useful for background analysis and our baffles
	code).  ADC, TDC, and flash ADC outputs are generated.  This
	basically does most basic detector analysis we need for now.
