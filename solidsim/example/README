The default macro SolidSim uses is defaultMacro.mac.  It includes
some basic visualization.

The default geometry is in defaultgeo.py.  It contains an example
of how to build an arbitrary geometry and associate sensitive
detectors and make magnetic fields.  It can be tested without SolidSim 
by running:

python testgeo.py

Output for the ROOT files is specified in outputdef.dat
