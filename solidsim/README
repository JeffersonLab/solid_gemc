This is the Geant4 SoLID simulation code.  It requires
the following packages to be installed:

	Geant4
	ROOT

It's a standard Geant4 installation (linked against
ROOT) so you can just run make to build it. The executable
is called SolidSim

Information and macros to run the thing is to come as 
they're developed
