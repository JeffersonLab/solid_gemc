SolidSim - Geant4 SoLID simulation

This is the Geant4 SoLID simulation code.  It requires
the following packages to be installed:

	Geant4 (with Python support implies:
		Python
		Boost C++/Python libraries
               )
	ROOT

It's a standard Geant4 installation (linked against
ROOT) so you can just run make to build it. The executable
is called SolidSim

You'll need to install a modified version of the Geant4 python
modules.  Run the script in config/getSolidGeant.sh to do it.
It will tell you what to add in your PYTHONPATH as well, which
is necessary to run everything.  You probably need to add the
current directory in there as well as '.'

There's an example that runs in example/.  The default macro
is defaultMacro.mac and the default path it looks for the
geometry description is defaultgeo.py

Information and macros to run the thing is to come as 
they're developed
