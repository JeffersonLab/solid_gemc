This sub-directory is for SIDIS rate estimation. The steps to get the rate is:

1, generate SIDIS events from the generator (use "GetSIDIS.C")
   e.g., ./run_he3_pip.sh or ./run_he3_pim.sh give the (e,pi+) and (e, pi-) events.
2, use "generate_weight.C" to add "weight" branch in each rootfiles generated by the generator
   e.g., root [1]: .L generate_weight.C++, root[2]: generate_weight()
3, make sure to locate the CLEO acceptance files (CDF acceptance file is also given but not a very good one)
   e.g., acceptance_solid_CLEO_SIDIS_3he_negative_output.root 
4, run generate_rate.C to calculate rates while genarate few plots. run getrate.C to get rates only.
   e.g., root [1]: .L getrate.C++,  root [2]: getrate("pion",1) for pi+
