=accep.C=
== Intro ==
accep.C gets the acceptance of a detector is provided by histograms in an acceptance file
then check every particles and record its acceptace by in new tree entry
Double_t accep_el_out_1,accep_minus_1,accep_plus_1,accep_recoil_1;
Double_t accep_el_out_2,accep_minus_2,accep_plus_2,accep_recoil_2;
Double_t accep_3fold_recoildecaypair;
Double_t accep_3fold_eloutdecaypair;
Double_t accep_4fold;
  
Some monitoring plots are drawn and saved during running  accep.C
acceptance*.png shows detector acceptance
BH_ThetaP*.png show 4 final particles generated, with individual acceptance, with overall acceptance in several rows
 
output particles info into a txt format LUND file is there, but commented out for now

TCS_Tree_infos.txt explain the tree entries

== how to run ==
(change relative path to yours)

first copy the root file produced by the generator to a new file with special name
cd /volatile/halla/solid/zwzhao/dilepton/TCSfiles
cp /volatile/halla/solid/mboer/Generator/TCSfiles/TCS_electroprod_1.root TCS_electroprod_1__SoLID_TCS_JPsiSetup_ele.root  


cp /u/scratch/mboer/TCS_electro2.root TCS_electro2_CLAS12_TCS_FTSetup_ele.root
cp /u/scratch/mboer/DDVCS_allxbj.root DDVCS_allxbj_SoLID_DDVCS_JPsiSetup_muon.root

The run the accep.C code with compliation in root
cd /home/zwzhao/solid/solid_svn/solid/evgen/dilepton/
ln -s ~/volatile/halla/solid/zwzhao/dilepton/TCSfiles ./
root
.x accep.C+("TCSfiles/TCS_electroprod_1__SoLID_TCS_JPsiSetup_ele.root")

.x accep.C+("~/volatile/halla/solid/mboer/Generator/TCS_electro2_CLAS12_TCS_FTSetup_ele.root")
.x accep.C+("/u/scratch/zwzhao/DDVCS_allxbj_SoLID_DDVCS_JPsiSetup_muon.root")

== info about exp==

Jlab ele beam pol is 0.84+-0.01

SoLID JPsiSetup has 15cm LH2 target with 1e37/cm2/s luminosity

CLAS12 ForwardTagger Setup has 15cm LH2 target with 1e35/cm/s luminosity

=table.C=
table.C read the root tree with acceptance output by accep.C, and bin it into 5D binnng and calculate acceptance in each bin and output result into a table in a txt file
(currently, input files are hardcoded)

The binning choice are now
8 Egamma (5-11), 8 tt (0.1-1), 8 Qp2 (4-9), 10 Phi_CMV(0-2pi), 15 Theta_CMV(45-135)

The txt format is 9 entries per line seperated by tab
Egamma tt Qp2 Phi_CMV Theta_CMV accep_3fold_recoildecaypair accep_3fold_eloutdecaypair accep_4fold Ngen 
(The 5 bin are just bin index for now)
