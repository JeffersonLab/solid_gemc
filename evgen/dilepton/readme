== Intro ==
first copy the root file produced by the generator to a new file
The run the accep.C code

accep.C gets the acceptance of a detector is provided by histograms in an acceptance file
then check every particles and record its acceptace by in new tree entry
Double_t accep_el_out_1,accep_minus_1,accep_plus_1,accep_recoil_1;
Double_t accep_el_out_2,accep_minus_2,accep_plus_2,accep_recoil_2;
Double_t accep;
accep*1 means acceptance by forwardangle detetor of SoLID, accep*2 means acceptance by largeangle detector of SoLID
accep means the total acceptance for SoLID
  if (accep_minus_2 > 0 && accep_plus_2 > 0) accep=0;
  else accep =  (accep_recoil_1+accep_recoil_2)*(accep_minus_1+accep_minus_2)*(accep_plus_1+accep_plus_2);
  
Some monitoring plots are drawn and saved during running  accep.C
acceptance.png shows detector acceptance
ThetaP.png show 4 final particles generated, with individual acceptance, with overall acceptance in three rows
 
output particles info into a txt format LUND file is there, but commented out for now
== how to run ==
cd /u/scratch/zwzhao/
cp /u/scratch/mboer/TCS_electro2.root TCS_electro2_solid.root

enter root, then run
.x /home/zwzhao/solid/solid_svn/solid/evgen/dilepton/accep.C+("TCS_electro2_solid.root","acceptance_solid_JPsi_electron_target315_output.root","TCS_Tree","ele")
