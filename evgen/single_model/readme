Attached is the our physics package for g2p. To use the WISER package:

G2PPhysBase *p = new G2PPhysWISER();

double pars[1];

pars[0] = 0.027; // Radiation length

p->SetPars(pars,1);

p->SetParsTarget(Z,A);

p->SetParticle(211); // Particle ID, follows PDG particle code

xs = p->GetXS(Ei,Pf,ang);


And the attached pdf file is a list of the models in this little package. 

Peter Bosted's webpage mentioned deuteron fit needs tweaking

== how to build a test code==

setup root env, then
make
./test

a file "trial.lund" will be produced with particles info
