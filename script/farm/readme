here are some scripts to submit farm job for solid simulation
(note this is not using for swif workflow submission, only old style simple Auger submission

SoLID full simulations at /work/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/ are done by these scripts

farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_dirty_weighted_eDIS is an example using code compiled on ifarm directly

farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_moved_dirty_weighted_eDIS is an example using code compiled inside a singularity container
which has a "load_singularity.sh" to run "do_it_all.sh" inside the container.
This is mainly because farm job command can't run singularity directly

To use it, do the following
====================================================
at ifarm, "cp -rpv thisdir /work/halla/solid/$USER/thisdir"

run "./LongRun_sim" to create output dir at /volatile/halla/solid/$USER/thisdir and give start and end run numbers
many job submission scripts jsc* will be created and submitted one after anther by "exec_sim"

"exec_sim" make sure the actual job script "do_it_all.sh" and "load_singularity.sh" in case of using container, and all other needed files like "solid.gcard" are copied to farm
It also define the output file names

Once job submitted, you can check its status by "jobstat -u $USER" or https://scicomp.jlab.org
wait for output files, out.*.root and out.*.log will appear in the output dir

If any job fails or the output files have problem, check farm out and err files at /farm_out/$USER for detailed reason
====================================================

note
1. modify "do_it_all.sh" and "load_singularity.sh" for your jobs and test first on ifarm to check its actual mem use and disk use, then adjust them in "exec_sim"
2. test a few of your job quickly using "TRACK : debug" by edit "exec_sim"
3. You may use "hadd" in root to add all resulting root files into a single root file
4. To overcome root file default 100GB size limit, you can do "root 'haddbig.C+'", then "setenv LD_PRELOAD $PWD/haddbig_C.so" before running "hadd"
