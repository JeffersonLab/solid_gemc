here are some scripts to submit farm job for solid simulation
(note this is not using swif workflow submission, only old style direct job submission

SoLID full simulations at /work/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/ are done by these scripts

how to use ===============================================
at ifarm, "cp -rpv thisdir /work/halla/solid/$USER/thisdir"

run "./LongRun_sim" to create output dir at /volatile/halla/solid/$USER/thisdir and give start and end run numbers
many job submission scripts jsc* will be created and submitted one after anther by "exec_sim"

"exec_sim" make sure the actual job script "do_it_all.sh" and "load_singularity.sh" in case of using container, and all other needed files like "solid.gcard" are copied to farm
It also define the output file names

Once job submitted, you can check its status by "jobstat -u $USER" or https://scicomp.jlab.org

output files including out.*.root and out.*.log will appear in the output dir
job err and out files will be there too

== note  =================================================

* modify "do_it_all.sh" and "load_singularity.sh" for your jobs and test first on ifarm to check its actual mem use and disk use, then adjust them in "exec_sim"
* test a few of your job quickly using "--partition=priority" by edit "exec_sim" 
* You may use "hadd" in root to add all output root files into a single root file. to overcome root file default 100GB size limit, you can do "root 'haddbig.C+'", then "setenv LD_PRELOAD $PWD/haddbig_C.so" before running "hadd"

==outdated Auger stuff ===============================================

* If any job fails or the output files have problem, check farm out and err files at /farm_out/$USER for detailed reason
* test a few of your job quickly using "TRACK : debug" by edit "exec_sim"

"farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_dirty_weighted_eDIS"
Auger example using code compiled on ifarm directly

"farm_solid_PVDIS_LD2_moved_dirty_weighted_eDIS"
Auger example using code compiled inside a singularity container
which has a "load_singularity.sh" to run "do_it_all.sh" inside the container.
This is mainly because farm job command can't run singularity directly
